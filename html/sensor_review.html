                                Android devices have sensors for motion, orientation, and environmental 
                                conditions. These sensors fall into three categories:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Motion Sensors:</strong> Detect acceleration and rotation for gaming and motion tracking.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Environmental Sensors:</strong> Measure temperature, pressure, light, etc., for weather updates and screen brightness control.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Position Sensors:</strong> Determine device orientation and position for navigation.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br />
                                Developers use the Android sensor framework to access and manage sensor data 
                                efficiently, conserving device resources. They can also target specific 
                                sensor configurations using Google Play filters and follow best practices 
                                for optimal performance.
